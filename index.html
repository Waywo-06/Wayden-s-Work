        <h11>Wayden Harker</h11>
        <p>An aspiring Game Developer | Game Enthusiast | Code Explorer</p>
        <p>Ever since I started tinkering with code, I’ve been drawn to the creative side of tech,especially building games that spark curiosity and excitement. 
        I’m fascinated by the potential of AI and how it can reshape the way we interact with the world, and I’m constantly diving into tools like Git to sharpen my skills and stay adaptable.
        What drives me most is the thrill of turning a wild idea into something real,something that makes people stop and say, 'Whoa, how did you do that?' That moment of surprise and delight is what I chase every time I build.</p>

      <h3>PROJECTS & IDEAS</h3>
      <p>I worked with a group of fellow developers on a food app concept which helps identify whether a food item is safe to eat or not. 
        The main goal of this app is to prevent people from contracting foodborne illnesses from food items they may purpose or consume. 
        This app was brought up to help communties in South Africa struggling with foodborne illnesses and to decrease the rate at which it spread.
        Incorporating artificial intelligence was a key requirement for the app’s development,it allowed us to implement dynamic decision-making, personalized interactions, and real-time data processing all of which were critical to the app’s functionality. </p>
